This is a sandbox repository for all the small tests I wanted to create without their own repository.
There are especially small codes developed for the students I'm working with.

## Usage

**sanbdox** analyses rely on the quarto documents that can be run with R and associated environment defined with [renv](#0).

## Project

**sanbdox** includes many subprojects, each with their own folder and documentation. 
Please explore them to understand how they work. However, the purpose of each folder is listed below.

**sanbdox** includes:

-   `bruis/` are analyses developed during the post doc of Bianca Ruis at the CRBE on modelling water table depth dynamics in TROLL.
-   `nrusso/` are analyses developed during the post doc of Nicholas Russo at Harvard on modelling the effect of defaunation in Central Africa on forest dynamics with TROLL.
-   `gbediaga/` are analyses developed during the doctorate of Gustavo Bediaga at F&S on Brazilian forest concessions Carbon balance.
-   `ialeixo/` are analyses developed during the post doc of Izabella Aleixo at INPA on modelling the effect of FACE Amazonia on forest dynamics with TROLL.
-   `lferrante/` are analyses developed during the master thesis of Lucas Ferrante Breda at F&S on the effect of fire and selective logging on forest height in Amazonia.
-   `mrojat/` are analyses developed during the doctorate of Margaux Rojat at AMAP on invasive plan species in the Reunion island.
-   `vbadouard/` are analyses developed during the doctorate of Vincyane Badouard at AMAP on canopy and undrestory species light niche in French Guiana.
-   `other/` are other unclassified analyses.

Other files are:

-   R environment definition with [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) in `renv/` and `renv/lock`
-   R files (`.Rbuildignore` , `.Rdata` , `.Rprofile` , `.Rhistory`)
-   Git and GitHub files (`.gitignore` )
-   Project documentation (`README.qmd` , `README.md`)
